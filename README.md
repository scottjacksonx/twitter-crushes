Tumblr has a thing called "Crushes" that shows you whose posts you've liked the most. I made a thing like that for Twitter that shows you whose twitters you've Favorited the most. You run it from the command-line, Van HÅ“t.

Usage:

`python twitter-crushes.py [username (xor) pages]`

Arguments:

`username`: your username (or the username of the person whose favorites you want to graph)

`pages`: the number of pages of favorites you want to graph (there are 20 favorites on each page, btw).
